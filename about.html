                    <h2>Why only women of color?</h2>
        <p>As we can all see through platforms such as Instagram and TikTok, mainstream media fails to acknowledge or highlight the successes and acomplishments of women of color. Although we love seeing all these amazing non-POC women thrive, we believe that women of color like ourselves deserve to have time in the spotlight as well. Our team is made up of women of color, and we all understand the struggles of achieving things but not having our successes be recognized.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>How do you get featured on the website?</h2>
        <p>To get featured on the website, you need to submit something (go to "What can I submit?"). Once you have submitted something, your submission will get "reviewed" by our team. We will collectively choose one person to be featured every month.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Is it a competition?</h2>
        <p>Definitely not! Women are often pitted against one another, and WOCE is not trying to continue that harmful cycle! Even if you don't get featured, the team's other favorites will also get posted on the site, in the "Creators" page. <br>
            Don't be discouraged if you aren't featured one month! Depending on how many submissions we have, we'll be trying to not repeat the same person two months in a row.</p>
            <br>
        <h2>Who can submit?</h2>
        <p>Anyone can submit, regardless of their race or gender. Women of color will be the ones who are most likely to be featured (and non-binary, genderqueer, gender fluid, and gender neutral individuals). To have a higher chance of being featured, check out our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/woce.womxn/">Instagram page</a> for prompts, topics, and more!</p>
        <br>
        <h2>What can I submit?</h2>
        <p>You can submit almost anything that you are proud of! As long as you feel your submission best represents you, your culture, however you identify yourself, or your accomplishments, all of your submissions are valid! Here are some examples: <br><br>
        - Writing (i.e. articles, poems, essays, etc.) <br>
    - Videos (i.e. dancing, singing, playing instruments, drawing/painting, playing sports, etc.) <br>
- Audio files (i.e. recordings of you singing, recordings of you playing instruments, interviews, etc.) <br>
- Artwork (i.e. paintings, drawings, digital art, etc.) <br> <br>
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us!</p>

                        <p>Mahathi Gopinathan is the founder and CEO of WOCE. As a woman of color, Mahathi knows that she may not get the same opportunities as her caucasian counterparts, or her male peers. Mahathi understands her own privilege as an Indian American and she works to help others who do not have the same privilege as her. She hopes everyone can learn to embrace their identities and be whoever they want to be.</p> 
                        <p style="text-align:center;"><img class="circular--square" src="reeya.png" alt="Reeya Kansra" width="140" height="140"></p>
                        <p>Reeya Kansra is the lead writer for the WOCE blog. She is a young woman with high aspirations towards journalism. Reeya's love of writing combined with her effortless nature around others pushes her above and beyond others her age. Reeya always fights for what is right, whether that be by posting important information, or by attending local protests. She is one of the more prominent voices for change in her local area and we are incredibly lucky to have her on our team.</p>
